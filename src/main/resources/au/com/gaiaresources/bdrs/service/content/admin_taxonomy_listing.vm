      To import a species or group of species from the

      <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?dtc/04-10-08">Life Science Identifier (LSID)</a>
      or list of 
      <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?dtc/04-10-08">LSIDs</a>, 
      separated by commas, in the text area below. You can also
      assign a group for the species to be imported into. If you leave the group 
      blank, species will be imported into family or kingdom groups. If you enter
      a group that does not exist, it will be created.
