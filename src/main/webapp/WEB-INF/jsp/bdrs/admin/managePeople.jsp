<h1>Manage People</h1>

<p>
This is the interface from where you can manage the people (Users) 
who have signed up to your Portal, including editing their details, 
adding them to Groups, and emailing them.  In the future, you will 
also be able to set your Portal preferences to allow the administrator 
to approve Users, as well.
