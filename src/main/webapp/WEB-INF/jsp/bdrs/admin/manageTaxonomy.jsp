<h1>Manage Taxonomy</h1>

<p>
	Taxonomy drives the available species for the Users to enter 
	into the system, and in this section you can also manage things 
	such as attributes that are specific to a particular Taxonomic 
	Group, and the content in the Species Pages for this Portal.  
	Functionality is broken into the individual taxonomic Species 
	and the broader Groups (collections of Species).
